ProxyFilter

If a filter-mapping url-pattern in the web.xml file matches the 
requested URL, then the request will be sent to the ProxyFilter, which 
will in turn forward the request.  A few searches and replaces are 
performed on the response to re-write URLs in response document.

The proxy point is hard-coded in:
/src/gov/loc/ndmso/ProxyFilter/ProxyFilter.java

The searches and replaces are hard-coded in 
/src/gov/loc/ndmso/ProxyFilter/RequestProxy.java

Install the built jar to the WEB-INF/lib directory.

Add to web.xml (after description but before listener or servlets):

    <filter>
      <filter-name>ProxyFilter</filter-name>
      <filter-class>gov.loc.ndmso.proxyfilter.ProxyFilter</filter-class>
    </filter>
    
	<filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>ProxyFilter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/lcds/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>ProxyFilter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/static/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
    <filter-mapping>
      <filter-name>ProxyFilter</filter-name>
      <url-pattern>/media/*</url-pattern>
    </filter-mapping>
    

Gratitude to Paul Tuckey of urlrewritefilter (http://code.google.com/p/urlrewritefilter/) 
and Joachim Ansorg, whose work was used by Tuckey.
